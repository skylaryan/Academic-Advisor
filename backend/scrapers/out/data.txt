We begin by asking what is \"HipHop,\" what is \"social justice,\" and what is their relationship, and proceed to consider how HipHop can be an effective force for social justice and what obstacles mitigate against this potential. These discussions will develop familiarity with important concepts in Black studies and social theory such as race and colonialism, imperialism and hegemony, structure and agency, identity and strategic essentialism. Weekly readings will typically pair writings specifically on HipHop with theory from across the humanities and social sciences including philosophy, sociology, cultural studies, and political economy.

But we also define art broadly, to encompass the material culture of everyday life, including jewelry, ceramics, and textiles. We consider the social and historical contexts of art and artistic production - art and imperialism, ethnicity, technology, religious ritual and belief, and myth and storytelling. These explorations address basic human concerns: death and the afterlife, desire and the body, self-definition and portraiture, power and propaganda, monstrosity and the supernatural, the divine and the sacred.

We will critically examine the concept of artistic genius; the influence of colonialism and imperialism on artistic production and consumption; the role of the patron and the art market in art's production and circulation; the relationship of fine art and popular culture; and the idea of globalization as it relates to \"western\" artistic traditions. Students will develop skills in visual analysis that can help them\nunderstand artistic production over the past 500 years as well as succeed in today's visually oriented culture.

In their quest to dominate the Islamic world and control the Mediterranean, each dynasty openly competed and responded to the others in architectural projects, ceremonial practices and courtly arts. At the same time, the monolithic model of courtly patronage of the arts was replaced gradually by one in which the urban classes increasingly shaped the art market, resulting in new visual forms. This course considers this turning point in the history of Islamic culture through the lens of art and architectural patronage. By exploring the architectural and urban projects of the three dynasties, we will examine competing visions of power, sources of\nlegitimacy and the development of Cairo, Baghdad/Samarra and Cordoba as capital cities. We will also consider the role of portable arts, addressing the role of exchange and gift-giving in the Mediterranean context and the problems of attribution in this highly mobile environment.

This course develops skills of critical reading and writing that are essential to majors and non-majors alike.\nPre-Reqs: 6 credits of introductory literature"], ["ENGL", "242", "Literature and Culture II: from the 18th Century to the Present", "3", "2017 Fall", "Course Description: This course considers a period of unparalleled tumult: a time of vast world empires and startling new technologies, revolutions that radically redefined self and community, two cataclysmic world wars, the emergence of ideas of human rights, and the first truly global feelings of interconnectedness. How has literature captured and contributed to these dramatic upheavals? Some writers worldwide have struggled to invent new forms, new words, and new genres to do justice to a world in crisis, while others have reached back in time, seeking continuity with the past. We will explore enduring traditions of poetry and drama and think about experiments in the new, globally popular genre of the novel.

At the same time, regardless of how a given culture has defined sex and gender and the behaviors and appearances deemed appropriate, humans have always exceeded those definitions. Quite simply, the determination of male and female and any other sex or gender category is neither obvious nor simple: what is sex, what is gender? Do they reside in the body, behavior, psyche, clothing, or social processes such\nas racialization? To make matters still more complicated, cultural beliefs about sex/gender have changed across time. How have contacts across cultures through migration and colonization affected people's understanding of sex/gender possibilities and norms? This course focuses on sex/gender crossing and variation in historical contexts including Japan, South Africa, Europe,\nthe African diaspora, and North America. We will consider perspectives of people who themselves passed, crossed, transitioned, transed, or otherwise exceeded their culture's definitions of normative sex/gender. Alongside, we will consider the ways that dominant social institutions reinforced norms, recognized, tolerated, punished and/or celebrated gender variation.

Students taking this class will achieve these objectives in three stages. Stage 1: The students will be given a GIS development problem which will require them to define the context and the scope of a project to address this problem, to identify the key issues in solving this problems, and to develop implementation plan as well as to implement the plan. In this stage the students will be trained on their independence on developing strategies and solutions to the problems (issues) as they arise during the process of solving a GIS development project. Stage 2: The student is first asked to conceive, in consultation with the instructor(s), a project requiring substantial amount of GIS programming and development, and then to define the scope and to develop the implementation plan as well as to implement the plan for solving this GIS development project. During this stage, the students are trained to derive GIS development projects from real world situation on their own and solve the GIS development problems on their own. The instructors will act as the clients as well as technical advisors to the projects. Stage 3?students will summarize their experiences by reflections on various aspects of developing and implementing the above two projects to assess the learning outcomes for this classes and to provide recommendations for people who engage in this type of GIS development projects.\nPre-Reqs: GEOG 378, 572, 574, 575, 576, and 579"], ["GEOG", "799", "Independent Reading", "1-3", "Graduate 50%: Y", "2016 Sprng", "Course Description: None provided.\nPre-Reqs: Consent of instructor"], ["GEOG", "901Topics Course", "Seminar in Cultural Geography", "2-3", "Graduate 50%: Y", "2009 Fall", "Course Description: None provided.\nPre-Reqs: Graduate or professional standing"], ["GEOG", "920Topics Course", "Seminar in Physical Geography", "1-3", "Graduate 50%: Y", "2009 Sprng", "Course Description: None provided.\nPre-Reqs: Graduate or professional standing"], ["GEOG", "930Topics Course", "Seminar in People-Environment Geography", "2-3", "Graduate 50%: Y", "2013 Sprng", "Course Description: Analysis of people-nature links, including environmental issues, natural resources, and attitudes toward nature.

Born an Austrian Jew and living in the German-speaking Diaspora of Prague, he spent his days making a living as a successful employee of an insurance company and his nights desperately trying to create fiction that met his own exacting expectations. Constantly at odds with the demands of his family, friends, and fiancees/female acquaintances and plagued by poor health, Franz Kafka struggled his entire life long to reconcile the irreconcilable: life and writing. Kafka's texts demand a transdisciplinary and comparative approach. They forged a new level and quality of literature that has triggered innumerable responses in many languages, media, and discourses. The term \"Kafkaesque\" makes clear that the type and dimension of Kafka's texts have been perceived as strange, uncanny, and resistant to any classification. In the attempt to adopt or imitate the Kafkaesque, other authors situate themselves in the literary tradition of the uncanny, which in part relies on the mystified city of Prague with its long Jewish tradition, as well as on the tradition of Romantic and \"Gothic\" texts. In this course, we will read a wide selection of texts by Franz Kafka in order to approach an understanding of his universe and prepare ourselves to view this universe in comparison with other contemporary authors as well as authors from other cultures and eras (A. Camus,, W. G. Sebald, T. Pynchon, H. Mulisch, P. Roth, H. Murakami).

At the same time, regardless of how a given culture has defined sex and gender and the behaviors and appearances deemed appropriate, humans have always exceeded those definitions. Quite simply, the determination of male and female and any other sex or gender category is neither obvious nor simple: what is sex, what is gender? Do they reside in the body, behavior, psyche, clothing, or social processes such\nas racialization? To make matters still more complicated, cultural beliefs about sex/gender have changed across time. How have contacts across cultures through migration and colonization affected people's understanding of sex/gender possibilities and norms? This course focuses on sex/gender crossing and variation in historical contexts including Japan, South Africa, Europe,\nthe African diaspora, and North America. We will consider perspectives of people who themselves passed, crossed, transitioned, transed, or otherwise exceeded their culture's definitions of normative sex/gender.
